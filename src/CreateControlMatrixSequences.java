         *  {rows}: number of rows in the matrix to be generated
         *  {columns}: number of columns in the matrix to be generated
         *  {sequenceCaption1}: first name of the command that will be generated
         *  {sequenceCaption2}:  a second name that will be generated (e.g. Mute Input 1 On, the "On" will be the second sequence name)
         *  {command1}: the first part of the command that will be generated (Output result: av input 1 On)
         *  {command2}:a second command that will be generated, if you have any command after the row
         *  {command3}:a third command that will be generated, will be inserted after column in the command sequence.(e.g. mute output 1 on, "on" will be second part of the command)
         *  {carriageReturn}: will the carriage return be generated or not (CAN BE TRUE/FALSE)
         *  {lineFeed}: will the line feed be generated or not (CAN BE TRUE/FALSE)
         *  caution//CAUTION!!
         *   1) The order of CR and LF will be same as in the object
         *   2) if you don't want to have a second sequenceCaption2 or command2, just leave the field empty
         *   3) do not insert any special character nor sequenceCaption1 or sequenceCaption2 (e.g. !"#Â¤%&/()=?)
         * 4) be extremely careful, if you are generating hex commands, do not insert "O" letter instead of "0"
