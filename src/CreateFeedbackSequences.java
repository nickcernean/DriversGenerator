         *  {lineFeed}: will the line feed be generated or not (CAN BE TRUE/FALSE)

         *   1) The order of CR and LF will be same as in the object
         *   2) if you don't want to have a second sequenceCaption2 or command2, just leave the field empty
         *   3) do not insert any special character nor sequenceCaption1 or sequenceCaption2 (e.g. !"#Â¤%&/()=?)
         *   4) be extremely careful, if you are generating hex commands, do not insert "O" letter instead of "0"
